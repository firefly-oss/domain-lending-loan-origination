# domain-lending-loan-origination

Domain layer microservice for loan origination within the Firefly lending platform. This service orchestrates the complete loan application lifecycle -- from initial submission through underwriting scoring, document attachment, and final approval or rejection -- using saga-based workflows with full compensation support.

## Overview

The Lending Domain Loan Origination service acts as the domain orchestration layer that sits between API consumers and the core lending origination persistence layer. It receives high-level business commands (e.g., "submit application", "score application", "approve application") and decomposes them into coordinated multi-step saga workflows executed via the FireflyFramework transactional saga engine.

### Key Features

- **Full application lifecycle management** -- submit, score, approve, reject, and withdraw loan applications through a single unified API
- **Saga-based orchestration** -- every multi-step operation runs as a compensating saga with automatic rollback on failure
- **CQRS architecture** -- strict separation of command and query responsibilities with dedicated buses, configurable timeouts, and query-level caching
- **Event-driven integration** -- each saga step emits domain events to Kafka (`domain-layer` topic) via the FireflyFramework EDA module
- **Reactive non-blocking I/O** -- built on Spring WebFlux with Project Reactor for end-to-end asynchronous processing
- **Virtual threads** -- Java virtual threads are enabled for improved concurrency under load
- **OpenAPI documentation** -- auto-generated Swagger UI for interactive API exploration (non-production profiles)

### Saga Workflows

| Saga | Description | Steps |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `RegisterApplicationSaga` | Orchestrates full application submission | Register loan application, then in parallel: parties, documents, collaterals, offers, status histories, score, and decision (all with compensation) |
| `RegisterApplicationDocumentSaga` | Attaches a single document to an existing application | Register application document |
| `RegisterScoreSaga` | Records an underwriting score against an application | Register underwriting score |
| `UpdateApplicationStatusSaga` | Transitions application status (approve/reject/withdraw) | Retrieve target status, retrieve loan application, retrieve old status, update application status, record status history |

### Downstream API Clients

The `ClientFactory` provisions the following API clients that call the core lending origination persistence layer:

- `LoanApplicationsApi`
- `ApplicationPartyApi`
- `ApplicationDocumentApi`
- `ApplicationCollateralApi`
- `ProposedOfferApi`
- `LoanApplicationStatusHistoryApi`
- `UnderwritingScoreApi`
- `UnderwritingDecisionApi`
- `ApplicationStatusApi`

## Setup

- **Apache Maven 3.9+**
- **Apache Kafka** running on `localhost:9092` (for event publishing)

## Development Guidelines

### Project Conventions

- **CQRS pattern:** All write operations are modeled as `Command` objects dispatched through the `CommandBus`; read operations use `Query` objects dispatched through the `QueryBus`
- **Saga orchestration:** Multi-step operations must be defined as `@Saga` classes with `@SagaStep` methods and corresponding compensate methods
- **Step events:** Every saga step should emit a `@StepEvent` for downstream event consumers
- **Constants:** Saga names, step IDs, compensate method names, and event types are centralized in `RegisterApplicationConstants` and `GlobalConstants`
- **DTOs as command bases:** Command classes extend SDK-generated DTOs (e.g., `RegisterLoanApplicationCommand extends LoanApplicationDTO`) to avoid redundant field definitions
- **Handlers:** Command handlers are annotated with `@CommandHandlerComponent` and extend `CommandHandler<C, R>`; query handlers use `@QueryHandlerComponent` and extend `QueryHandler<Q, R>`

### Adding a New Operation

1. Define a `Command` or `Query` class in the `commands`/`queries` package
2. Create a `CommandHandler` or `QueryHandler` in the `handlers` package
3. If the operation is multi-step, define a new `@Saga` class in the `workflows` package with steps, compensations, and events
4. Add constants for the saga, steps, compensations, and events to the appropriate constants class
5. Expose the operation through `LoanOriginationService` and the controller

## Monitoring

| `/actuator/info` | Application information |

- **Liveness:** `/actuator/health/liveness`
- **Readiness:** `/actuator/health/readiness`

### Logging
